In this project, i will use perceptrons to model the fundamental building blocks of computers — logic gates.

Perceptrons can’t solve problems that aren’t linearly separable. However, if multiple perceptrons are combined together, we will have a neural net that can solve these problems!

This is incredibly similar to logic gates. AND gates and OR gates can’t produce the output of XOR gates, but when we combine a few ANDs and ORs, we can make an XOR!
