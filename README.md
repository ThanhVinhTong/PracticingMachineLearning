# PracticingMachineLearning
This is just a repository for practicing some machine learning algorithms that i studied over the university period

Some sources i used to study from are:
  - Codecademy: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/machine-learning
  - Machine Learning cơ bản: https://machinelearningcoban.com/
  - Some free videos from youtube
  - Andrew Ng's free lectures from coursera
